# Articulate 360

Articulate 360 is a virtual-reality project that brings historic and contemporary artworks into a 360 gallery space, animates the artworks and offers narration on their historical contexts and points of interest. The space was created with React 360, the animated artworks were activated with a combination of React and React Native animation techniques.
